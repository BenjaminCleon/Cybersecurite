The Chinese Remainder Theorem gives a unique solution to a set of linear congruences if their moduli are coprime.

This means, that given a set of arbitrary integers ai, and pairwise coprime integers ni, such that the following linear congruences hold:

x ≡ a1 mod n1
x ≡ a2 mod n2
...
x ≡ an mod nn
