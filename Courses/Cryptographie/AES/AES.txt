What exactly is AES??

AES is an acronym for Advandced Encryption System
It's a method to encrypt data which inherits from DES ( Data Encrypted System )

AES is a block cypher encryption, that's mean that your text is split into block ( of bytes )and each block are encrypted

If I have a message like this "Welcome to this course about AES". I'm going to split this sentences into block of 16 bytes like this.
1st block "Welcome to this " and 2nd block "course about AES". Obviously, it will be the hex or the binary representation that must be used.
But why I took 16 bytes and not other length ?
Because AES must be use with a fix length and there are three common lengths which are used for AES.

There are :
 - AES-128 which means that cipher length block is 128 bits so 16 bytes. 
 - AES-192 which means that cipher length block is 192 bits so 24 bytes. 
 - AES-256 which means that cipher length block is 256 bits so 32 bytes.

Bigger the length is, bigger the security is but bigger the time to decrypt is too.

So what about the steps of AES. 

There are 3 steps in AES.
1. AddRoundKey
2. Repeat 9 times 4 operations
3. Repeat a last time 3 among the 4 previous operations

Let's look about the 2nd step.

We have into this steps, 4 operations which called:
1. SubBytes
2. ShiftRows
3. MixColumns
4. AddRoundKey

SubBytes it's an operation which consist to take a correspondences table called S-BOX and permute the value of each byte into the cipher block
Let's take our first previous block and convert him into hex notation
So "Welcome to this " => "57656c636f6d6520746f207468697320".
Now let's present such as a matrix 4x4
[ 57, 65, 6c, 63 ]
[ 6f, 6d, 65, 20 ]
[ 74, 6f, 20, 74 ]
[ 68, 69, 73, 20 ]
Now let's do the SubBytes opeartion in according to the S-BOX that I downloaded on the web and which is in this folder.
[ 5b, 4d, 50, aa ]
[ a8, 6c, 4d, b7 ]
[ 92, a8, b7, 92 ]
[ 45, f9, 8f, b7 ]

Okay, now let's go to the next operation

ShiftRows it's an easy operation which consists to permute the cases from the right to the left, begin by the first case of each row and rotating as much as the line number
[ 5b, 4d, 50, aa ] x 0 ==> [ 5b, 4d, 50, aa ] x 0
[ a8, 6c, 4d, b7 ] x 1 ==> [ 6c, 4d, b7, a8 ] x 1
[ 92, a8, b7, 92 ] x 2 ==> [ b7, 92, 92, a8 ] x 2
[ 45, f9, 8f, b7 ] x 3 ==> [ b7, 45, f9, 8f ] x 3

Now MixColumns
MixColums represents the multiplcation between each colums and a given matric which is:
[02, 03, 01, 01]
[01, 02, 03, 01]
[01, 01, 02, 03]
[03, 01, 01, 02]

So we will do the next operation for the first row and repeat them for each row
[02, 03, 01, 01]    [ 5b, 4d, 50, aa ]
[01, 02, 03, 01]  X [ 6c, 4d, b7, a8 ]
[01, 01, 02, 03]    [ b7, 92, 92, a8 ]
[03, 01, 01, 02]    [ b7, 45, f9, 8f ]

But there is another thing to take in count and it's hard to explain by writing.
I found this video which may help you to understand.
